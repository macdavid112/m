# Google-Hacking-Database (GHDB)

  The Google-Hacking-Database (GHDB) is a comprehensive collection of Google search queries, known as "Google Dorks," that help security professionals discover sensitive information exposed online. These queries utilize advanced search operators to locate specific types of data, such as files containing passwords, vulnerabilities on web servers, and other publicly available information that can be leveraged in security assessments. The GHDB is an essential resource for ethical hackers, penetration testers, and anyone interested in cybersecurity.

## Advanced Search

Google Dorking describes the process of using advanced search filters that allow to retrieve more efficient results. It is a technique often used by cybersecurity professionals in order to find valuable information about a target. While Google Dorking itself is legal (in most countries), it might quickly lead to actions that aren't, such as visiting sites with illegal content. Hence using [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/) or a [VPN](https://privacyguides.org/vpn/) is recommended. Using a search aggregator like [SearX](https://searx.github.io/searx/) can enhance search privacy and efficiency.
